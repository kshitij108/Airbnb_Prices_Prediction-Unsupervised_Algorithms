Submit Deliverable One: Jupyter Notebook or PDF Report

The Jupyter notebook should show a brief problem description, EDA procedure, analysis (model building and training), results, and discussion/conclusion. If your work doesn't fit into one notebook (or you think it will be less readable by having one large notebook), make several notebooks or scripts in the GitHub repository (as deliverable 3) and submit a report-style notebook or pdf instead.

If your project doesn't fit into jupyter notebook format (E.g. you built an app that uses ML), write your approach as a report and submit it in a pdf form.

Is the data description explained properly? The data description should include the data size.

E.g. for tabulated data: number of samples/rows, number of features/columns, bytesize if a huge file, data type of each feature (or just a summary if too many features- e.g. 10 categorical, 20 numeric features), description of features (at least some key features if too many), whether the data is multi-table form or gathered from multiple data source.

E.g. for images: you can include how many samples, number of channels (color or gray or more?) or modalities, image file format, whether images have the same dimension or not etc.

E.g. sequential data: texts, sound file; please describe appropriate properties such as how many documents or words, how many sound files with typical length (are they the same or variable), etc.

0 points

Exploratory Data Analysis

Does it include clear explanations on how and why an analysis (EDA) is performed?

EDA methods can differ by data types or tasks.

E.g. EDA on tabulated data may include: visualization and statistics on selected features, null value checks, identifying data types of each features etc.

E.g. EDA on images is open-ended, and it can be as simple as picking a few samples of images from each class, displaying them, and describing any findings. 

Some more ideas: you could plot histograms of sample images and draw conclusions. You could summarize image similarity by choosing a single metric to compare. The data may or may not have different image sizes, but you could mention if the image sizes are different. Also, you can check the distribution of the range of the pixel intensities. You may also count labels (if multiclass or multilabel classification problem) to see if the labels are skewed, or you can plot a histogram of areas by segmentation labels, etc.

EDA on text/NLP data may include: Word count, word frequency histogram, etc., and it can also include basic data cleaning such as stop words removal to count meaningful words. 

EDA on sound or speech data may involve label count/histogram, visualization on their waveform, the histogram of the length, visualization of their spectrum, etc.

EDA on sequential data such as stock/house price, sensor measurement data, sequence of system logs, etc. may include: Visualization of the time series, smoothing/moving averages, or other relevant visualizations. Depending on the data, one can discuss specific data characteristics such as seasonality or some pattern.

Note: Sometimes, the data type can be multimodal (meaning, mixtures of images, texts, sounds, or tabular format). Score according to relevant EDA methods used for the data type.


10 points
EDA goes above and beyond expectations. Includes both of the following: In addition to exploring the dataset, EDA includes several histograms and/or other types of visualizations.


7 points

Data Preprocessing

Note: There are many possible data types you might see from projects from other people. Below are potential score breakdowns based on data types:

Below are potential score breakdowns based on data types. 

Data preprocessing on tabulated data may include: Removing irrelevant features, null value imputation, resampling, general data cleaning (clean and change string values to numeric values), one-hot encoding (creating dummy variables for multi categorical variables), changing the data representation, reindexing, etc.

Data preprocessing on images may include: Rescaling or scoping images, normalizing/standardizing the pixel values, color filtering/gray scaling if relevant, and data augmentation (rotation, flip, translation, etc.)

Data preprocessing on texts/NLP data may include: Extracting feature vectors from raw texts such as word count tables or word embeddings. There are many word embedding methods, and some can be complex. When you evaluate, don't just base the score on the complexity or performance of the models. Base your score on how the learner demonstrated understanding by explaining concepts, why they chose particular methods/techniques, etc.  

Data preprocessing on speech/sound data (or any data that involves sound) may include: cropping or (random) sampling of waveform data, transforming to spectrums (e.g., power spectrums, discrete Fourier transform, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients MFCC, etc.)

If the data types are multimodal, please grade them according to the appropriate methods.

The student may use other preprocessing methods for different data types than the ones above. As long as the methods and reasoning make sense, score them appropriately.

In some cases, the data may not need any preprocessing. Then the learner must give a detailed explanation why the data does not need preprocessing (e.g., the original data has been already provided in the processed format and/or preprocessing compromised or did not improve model performance, etc.)

** Note: If the project includes data scraping or pipelining, consider it as data preprocessing.

Models

Some questions to consider:

Is the choice of model(s) appropriate for the problem? (E.g., at least one or more unsupervised) for the problem and data.

Explain the general approach.

Used additional unsupervised or supervised models to compare.

 Aware of the time complexity of the particular algorithm and assess the feasibility of the algorithm on the data, choose algorithm(s) based on those assessments.

Does it include reasonings on the choice of optimization methods or training methods? If a specific optimization method or training strategy is an important design choice, it briefly explains what it does or how it works.

One option for the project is to create something that isn't only analysis. E.g., an application using unsupervised algorithms (for example, a functioning web app, recommender system, etc.). Data collection and choosing algorithms/designing the system for actual response times may be more critical than having accurate but slow methods. If building an application-type project, use the following rubric instead:

Implement reasonable data scraping methods or data pipeline

Correctly choose a model (at least one or more unsupervised) for the problem and data.  

Explain the general approach.

Has working application.

Aware of the time complexity and scalability for data pipelines and backend algorithms, design the system accordingly.

Results and Analysis

Some questions to consider:

Does it have a summary of results and analysis?

Does it have proper visualizations? (E.g., tables, graphs/plots, heat maps, statistics summary with interpretation, etc.)

Does it use different kinds of evaluation metrics properly? Suppose the supervised or unsupervised learning task has more than one possible evaluation metric. In that case, the learner could compare multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., a classification task may use several evaluation metrics other than just accuracy or cross-entropy for better evaluation interpretation). 

Hyperparameter search: Some models may involve hyperparameter search. Students need to describe their hyperparameter procedure. Hyperparameters may exist in the model itself and/or in the optimization objective functions or regularizations. Also, modifications on their data preprocessing may occur during the training and hyperparameter tuning. Result and analysis need to address the final results and any intermediate results and demonstrate the hyperparameter search procedure. If one uses an automatic hyperparameter search tool(s), they must briefly describe how it works and the final results and interpretation.

Did the author compare the results from the multiple models and make appropriate comparisons?

Submit Deliverable Three: GitHub Repository Link

Create a public project GitHub repository with your work (please include the git repo URL in your notebook/report and slides). It is essential that it is public so your peers will be able to access it. This repository needs to be specifically for this project. 

Data by-product: If your project creates data and you want to share, please do not upload the data in git. An excellent way to share would be through a Kaggle dataset or similar. Similarly, please do not upload videos to git- if you want, you can upload to youtube and post those link(s) to your git.

##Unsupervised Market Segmentation of European Airbnb Listings

The goal of this project is to identify and analyze distinct segments of Airbnb listings across several major European cities. While the original problem focused on predicting price (a supervised task), a deeper understanding of the market can be achieved by first identifying what kind of listings exist. For example, are there common patterns that define "budget solo-traveler rooms" versus "spacious family apartments" or "business-ready central flats"?

By using unsupervised clustering algorithms, we aim to uncover these data-driven personas or segments without any preconceived labels. The analysis will focus on characterizing these segments based on their features (e.g., size, location, ratings) and then examining how pricing strategies differ across them.

Primary Unsupervised Learning Task: Clustering Models to be Compared: K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN Dataset: Airbnb listings data for Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, and Budapest.

Project Steps:

Step 1: Data Gathering and Provenance
Step 2: Identifying the Unsupervised Learning Problem
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Inspect, Visualize, and Clean the Data
Step 4: Analysis Using Unsupervised Learning Models
Step 5: Discussion and Conclusion
